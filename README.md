## **NMR Experiment**
The goal of this experiment was to identify the predominant β-diketone in Benzene. All the solvents used were aprotic. The solvents were: Acetone, Acetonitrile, Benzene, Chloroform, Cyclohexane, Dimethylsulfoxide, and Toluene. Our main task was to obtain the 1H NMR spectrum of 2,4-pentadione existing in each of the given solvents. After the NMR was obtained, the following conclusions were gathered: In solvents which do not specifically interact with the keto or enol forms, as for example through hydrogen bond formation, the keto form is increasingly stabilized with increasing dielectric constant of the solvent and the enol form is favored. In cases were the solvent is the same and the temperatures varied it was found that with increasing temperature the Ke decreased. 

The purpose of this experiment was to obtain the 1H NMR spectrum of 2,4-pentanedione in a series of aprotic solvents, the b-diketone that predominates in each solvent was determined and using a van’t Hoff plot ΔH and ΔS for this equilibrium was determined. To do this an NMR machine was used A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, or also known as an NMR, is used to determine the purity of a sample, along with determining the molecular structure of the solvent used. 
The Van 't Hoff relates the change in the equilibrium constant, Keq, of a chemical reaction to the change in temperature, T, given the standard enthalpy change, ΔH, for the process. In a plot the y-intercept represent ΔS/R and the slope represents -ΔH/R.

The usual rule that is applied to rationalize the effect of solvent on the percentage of enol in a β-diketone is that the enol tautomer is less polar than the keto tautomer and therefore polar solvents stabilize the keto tautomer over the corresponding enol tautomer. In solvents which do not specifically interact with the keto or enol forms, as for example through hydrogen bond formation, the keto form is increasingly stabilized with increasing dielectric constant of the solvent and the enol form is favored. For example: DMSO, where the enol form is favored. 

With Benzene as a solvent it was found that with increasing temperature the Ke decreased. Another finding was that the solvent with that is going to be the most spontaneous was cyclohexane.
